To assist with log analysis the following configuration can be placed at the bottom of /etc/rsyslog.conf configuration file:

# this line creates a template that will store the messages for each host in a seperate file.
# a new file will be created daily because of the date in the filename.
$template DailyPerHostLogs,"/var/log/host-logs/%$YEAR%-%$MONTH%-%$DAY%/%HOSTNAME%.log"
*.* -?DailyPerHostLogs;TraditionalFormat

The syslog server should be restarted following this change:

sudo /etc/init.d/rsyslog restarted
