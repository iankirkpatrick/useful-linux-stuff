1. Install subversion:

sudo apt-get install subversion

2. Create a directory for the svn repositories: 

sudo mkdir /usr/local/svn

3. Create an svn user group:

sudo groupadd svn

4. Assign ownership of /usr/local/svn to the svn group:

sudo chgrp svn /usr/local/svn/

5. Assign write permission to group svn:

sudo chmod g+w /usr/local/svn

6. Assign ownership of subdirectories to svn group: 

sudo chmod g+s /usr/local/svn

7. Add svn group to user accounts: 

sudo usermod -a -G svn <username>

verify:

id <username>

8. Create svn repository network:

umask 002
sudo svnadmin create /usr/local/svn/network
umask 022

9. Checkout network repository:

In your home directory
svn checkout file:///usr/local/svn/network network

This will checkout the repository and create the folder network under the users home directory.

You should now be able to add and commit files to the svn repository under the network directory.

Automatically checkout svn at user logon:

1. To simplify the process for users, the following can be added into .bashrc under the users home directory. Each time they logon the svn repository will be checked out: 

# Checkout SVN repoistory
svn checkout file:///usr/local/svn/network network


Backup and restore:
It is recommended to have a working backup of the svn repository on another host. However it should be noted that changes should only be made on one server (master), that way we avoid conflicts. 

1. Use the following script to backup the master repository and copy the backup to the slave: 

sudo svnadmin dump /usr/local/svn/network > /home/<username>/svnbackup
scp /home/<username>/svnbackup <username>@<slave-hostname>:/home/<username>/svnbackup

2. Use the following script to restore the backup from the master onto the slave:

sudo rm -f -r /usr/local/svn/network/*
umask 002
sudo svnadmin create /usr/local/svn/network
umask 022
sudo svnadmin load /usr/local/svn/network < svnbackup
